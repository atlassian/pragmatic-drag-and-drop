  The cleanup functions returned by the following utilities now only work on the first call. This
  was done to prevent unexpected side effects of calling a cleanup function multiple times.

  - `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element`
    - `draggable`
    - `dropTargetForElements`
    - `monitorForElements`

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#172374](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/172374)
  [`4ca6346256c8a`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/4ca6346256c8a) -
  Minor increase of time dampening duration. After lots of explorations, we have increased the value
  to make it easier for people to avoid the impacts of rapid scroll speed spikes when lifting or
  entering into a high scroll speed area.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#170839](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/170839)
  [`1534389dcb75b`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/1534389dcb75b) -
  In order to improve clarity, we have renamed the `from*Edge` (eg `fromTopEdge`) argument
  properties to `for*Edge` (eg `forTopEdge`) for the overflow scroller. If you are not using
  overflow scrolling, there is nothing you need to do.

  ```diff
  - fromTopEdge
  + forTopEdge
  - fromRightEdge
  + forRightEdge
  - fromBottomEdge
  + forBottomEdge
  - fromLeftEdge
  + forLeftEdge
  ```

  ```diff
  const unbind = unsafeOverflowAutoScrollForElements({
  		element,
  		getOverflow: () => ({
  -			fromTopEdge: {
  +			forTopEdge: {
  				top: 6000,
  				right: 6000,
  				left: 6000,
  			},
  -			fromRightEdge: {
  +			forRightEdge: {
  				top: 6000,
  				right: 6000,
  				bottom: 6000,
  			},
  -			fromBottomEdge: {
  +			forBottomEdge: {
  				right: 6000,
  				bottom: 6000,
  				left: 6000,
  			},
  -			fromLeftEdge: {
  +			forLeftEdge: {
  				top: 6000,
  				left: 6000,
  				bottom: 6000,
  			},
  		}),
  });
  ```

  We thought that `for*` more accurately represented what was being provided, as these are the
  overflow definitions _for_ a defined edge.

  We have also improved the types for `for*Edge` so that you do not need to provide redundant cross
  axis information if you only want to overflow scroll on the main axis.

  ```diff
  const unbind = unsafeOverflowAutoScrollForElements({
  		element,
  		getOverflow: () => ({
  			forTopEdge: {
  				top: 100,
  +       // no longer need to pass `0` for the cross axis if you don't need it
  -				right: 0,
  -				left: 0,
  			},
  			forRightEdge: {
  				right: 100,
  -				top: 0,
  -				bottom: 0,
  			},
  			forBottomEdge: {
  				bottom: 100,
  -				right: 0,
  -				left: 0,
  			},
  			forLeftEdge: {
  				left: 100,
  -				top: 0,
  -				bottom: 0,
  			},
  		}),
  });
  ```

  When declaring overflow scrolling for an edge, you cannot provide how deep the scrolling should
  occur into the element (that is defined by the "over element" overflow scroller). Providing
  redundant information for an edge will now also give a type error rather than providing no
  feedback.

  ```ts
  const unbind = unsafeOverflowAutoScrollForElements({
  	element,
  	getOverflow: () => ({
  		forTopEdge: {
  			top: 100,
  			bottom: 30, // ‚ùå now a type error
  		},
  		forRightEdge: {
  			right: 100,
  			left: 10, // ‚ùå now a type error
  		},
  		forBottomEdge: {
  			bottom: 100,
  			top: 200, // ‚ùå now a type error
  		},
  		forLeftEdge: {
  			left: 100,
  			right: 20, // ‚ùå now a type error
  		},
  	}),
  });
  ```

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#116572](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/116572)
  [`98c65e7ff719c`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/98c65e7ff719c) -
  üçØ Introducing "the honey pot fix" which is an improved workaround for a
  [painful browser bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41129937).

  **Background**

  The browser bug causes the browser to think the users pointer is continually depressed at the
  point that the user started a drag. This could lead to incorrect events being triggered, and
  incorrect styles being applied to elements that the user is not currently over during a drag.

  **Outcomes**

  - Elements will no longer receive `MouseEvent`s (eg `"mouseenter"` and `"mouseleave"`) during a
    drag (which is a violation of the
    [drag and drop specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model))
  - Elements will no longer apply `:hover` or `:active` styles during a drag. Previously consumers
    would need to disable these style rules during a drag to prevent these styles being applied.
  - Dramatically improved post drop performance. Our prior solution could require a noticeable delay
    due to a large style recalculation after a drop.

### Patch Changes

### Minor Changes

- [#57337](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/57337)
  [`4ad3fa749a5c`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/4ad3fa749a5c) -
  Adding the ability to increase the maximum automatic scroll speed.

  ```diff
  autoScrollForElements({
    element: myElement,
  +  getConfiguration: () => ({maxScrollSpeed: 'fast' | 'standard'}),
  })
  ```

  `getConfiguration()` is a new _optional_ argument be used with all auto scrolling registration
  functions:

  - `autoScrollForElements`
  - `autoScrollWindowForElements`
  - `autoScrollForFiles`
  - `autoScrollWindowForFiles`
  - `unsafeOverflowForElements`
  - `unsafeOverflowForFiles`

  ```ts
  autoScrollForElements({
    element: myElement,
    getConfiguration: () => ({ maxScrollSpeed : 'fast' })
  }),
  ```

  We recommend using the default `"standard"` max scroll speed for most experiences. However, on
  _some_ larger experiences, a faster max scroll speed (`"fast"`) can feel better.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#42668](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/pull-requests/42668)
  [`0a4e3f44ba3`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0a4e3f44ba3) - We have
  landed a few fixes for "overflow scrolling"

  - Fix: Time dampening could be incorrectly reset when transitioning from "over element" auto
    scrolling to "overflow" auto scrolling for certain element configurations.
  - Fix: Parent "overflow scrolling" registrations could prevent overflow scrolling on children
    elements, if the parent was registered first.
  - Fix: "overflow scrolling" `canScroll() => false` would incorrectly opt out of "overflow
    scrolling" for younger registrations.

  [`7803a90e9c6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7803a90e9c6) - This
  change makes it so that distance dampening is based on the size of the hitbox and not the
  container. Now that we clamp the size of the hitbox, our distance dampening needs to be based on
  the size of the hitbox, and not the container.

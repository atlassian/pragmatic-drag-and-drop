 * element (which will be a child of the `body` element).
 *
 * **iOS, iPadOS and Android**
 *
 * The drag preview will be centered under the users pointer rather than
 * pushed away on iOS due to platform limitations.

		 * **Approach: transparent borders.**
		 *
		 * The only reliable cross browser technique found to push a
		 * drag preview away from the cursor is to use transparent borders on the container.
		 *
		 * **ðŸ™…ðŸ“± Not pushing the preview away on touch devices**
		 *
		 * _On iOS_
		 *
		 * Safari will set the transparent border color to be black
		 *
		 * `iOS@18.4.1` on May 7th 2025:
		 * - If you set the background color on the `container` the border color will be that
		 * - Setting a transparent background color on the `container` still results in a
		 *   black border
		 * - The `<body>` text or background color does not change the black border color
		 *
		 * While dragging, the drag preview will shift under the center of the users pointer.
		 * So if you start at {x: 0, y: 0} (top left), almost immediately the preview will move
		 * to be under the middle of the users pointer.
		 *
		 * _On Android_
		 *
		 * Chrome will put the center of the drag preview under the users pointer immediately.
		 *
		 * Tested on `Chrome@137` on `Android 14` on June 20th 2025
		 *
		 * _What we do_
		 *
		 * We don't add the transparent border
		 *
		 * - Avoid the black color on iOS
		 * - It isn't needed on Android anyway as the preview will be under the center
		 *   of the users pointer
		 *
		 * We put the center of the drag preview under the users pointer
		 *
		 * - Avoids the drag preview quickly moving from a top corner to be centered under
		 *   the users pointer on iOS
		 * - It will be under the center on Android no matter what we do
		 *
		 * We previously had a isTouchDevice() check, but it felt safer for now
		 * to have a more targeted check, as these are the devices that have been
		 * tested on.

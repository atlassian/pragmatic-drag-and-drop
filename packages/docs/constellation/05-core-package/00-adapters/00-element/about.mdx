The element adapter enables you to create rich drag and drop experiences, such as lists, boards, grids, resizing and so on.

The element adapter contains the essential pieces for element operations:

- [draggable](#draggable): enable dragging of an element.
- [dropTargetForElements](#drop-target-for-elements): marking an element as a valid [drop target](../../drop-targets)
- [monitorForElements](#monitor-for-elements): create a [monitor](../../monitors) to listen for element drag operation events anywhere.
- [types](#types): all types for this adapter.

There are also a number of **optional** element utilities:

- [setCustomNativeDragPreview](./drag-previews): use a new element as the native drag preview
- [pointerOutsideOfPreview](./drag-previews): native drag preview function to place the users pointer outside of the drag preview
- [centerUnderPointer](./drag-previews): native drag preview function to place the center of the ntaive drag preview under the users pointer
- [preserveOffsetOnSource](./drag-previews): native drag preview function to match the pointer position on a native drag preview as close as possible to the pointer position on the draggable element
- [disableNativeDragPreview](./drag-previews): disable the native drag preview (helpful if you want to use your own custom drag preview or have no drag preview)
- [scrollJustEnoughIntoView](./drag-previews): scroll an element just enough into view so it is visible (helpful when working with default native drag previews)

## Draggable

A `draggable` is an `HTMLElement` that can be dragged around by a user.

A `draggable` can be located:

- Outside of any drop targets
- Inside any amount of levels of nested drop targets
- So, anywhere!

While a drag operation is occurring:

- You can add new `draggable`s
- You can remount a `draggable`. See [Reconciliation](../../reconciliation)
- You can change the dimensions of the dragging `draggable` during a drag. But keep in mind that won't change the drag preview image, as that is collected only at the start of the drag (in `onGenerateDragPreview()`)
- You can remove the dragging `draggable` during a drag operation. When a `draggable` is removed it's event functions (eg `onDrag`) will no longer be called. Being able to remove the dragging `draggable` is a common requirement for virtual lists

### Draggable argument overview

- `element: HTMLElement`: a `HTMLElement` that will be draggable (using `HTMLElement` as that is the interface that allows the `"draggable"` attribute)
- `dragHandle?: Element`: an optional `Element` that can be used to designate the part of the `draggable` that can exclusively used to drag the whole `draggable`
- `canDrag?: (args: GetFeedbackArgs) => boolean`: used to conditionally allow dragging (see below)
- `getInitialData?: (args: GetFeedbackArgs) => Record<string, unknown>`: a one time attaching of data to a draggable as a drag is starting
- `getInitialDataForExternal?: (args: GetFeedbackArgs) => {[Key in NativeMediaType]?: string;}`: used to attach native data (eg `"text/plain"`) to other `window`s or applications.

```ts
type GetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The user input as a drag is trying to start (the `initial` input)
   */
  input: Input;
  /**
   * The `draggable` element
   */
  element: HTMLElement;
  /**
   * The `dragHandle` element for the `draggable`
   */
  dragHandle: Element | null;
};
```

- [`onGenerateDragPreview`](../events)
- [`onDragStart`](../events)
- [`onDrag`](../events)
- [`onDropTargetChange`](../events)
- [`onDrop`](../events)

### Drag handles

A _drag handle_ is the part of your `draggable` element that can be dragged in order to drag the whole `draggable`. By default, the entire `draggable` acts as a _drag handle_. However, you can optionally mark a child element of a `draggable` element as the _drag handle_.

```ts
draggable({
  element: myElement,
  dragHandle: myDragHandleElement,
});
```

You can also implement a _drag handle_ by making a small part of an element the `draggable`, and then using [`setCustomNativeDragPreview`](./drag-previews) to generate a preview for the entire entity.

### Conditional dragging (`canDrag()`)

A `draggable` can conditionally allow dragging by using the `canDrag()` function. Returning `true` from `canDrag()` will allow the drag, and returning `false` will prevent a drag.

```ts
draggable({
  element: myElement,
  // disable dragging
  canDrag: () => false,
});
```

<Example Component={NestedDraggablesExample} appearance="showcase-only" />

Disabling a drag by returning `false` from `canDrag()` will prevent any other `draggable` on the page from being dragged. `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` calls `event.preventDefault()` under the hood when `canDrag()` returns `false`, which cancels the drag operation. Unfortunately, once a drag event has started, a `draggable` element cannot individually opt out of dragging and allow another element to be dragged.

If you want to disable dragging for a `draggable`, but still want a parent `draggable` to be able to be dragged, then rather than using `canDrag()` you can conditionally apply `draggable()`

Here is example of what that could look like using `react`:

```ts
import {useEffect} from 'react';
import {draggable} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

function noop(){};

function Item({isDraggingEnabled}: {isDraggingEnabled: boolean}) {
  const ref = useRef();

  useEffect({
    // when disabled, don't make the element draggable
    // this will allow a parent draggable to still be dragged
    if(!isDraggingEnabled) {
      return noop;
    }
    return draggable({
      element: ref.current,
    });
  }, [isDraggingEnabled]);

  return <div ref={ref}>Draggable item</div>
};
```

## Data for external consumers (`getInitialDataForExternal()`)

`getInitialDataForExternal()` allows you want to attach data to a drag operation that can be used by other `windows`s or applications (externally)

```ts
draggable({
  element: myElement,
  getInitialData: () => ({ taskId: task.id }),
  getInitialDataForExternal: () => ({
    'text/plain': task.description,
    'text/uri-list': task.url,
  }),
});
```

We also have a helper `formatURLsForExternal(urls: string[]): string` that allows you to attach multiple urls for external consumers.

```ts
import { formatURLsForExternal } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/format-urls-for-external';

draggable({
  element: myElement,
  getInitialData: () => ({ taskId: task.id }),
  getInitialDataForExternal: () => ({
    'text/plain': task.description,
    'text/uri-list': formatURLsForExternal([task.url, task.anotherUrl]),
  }),
});
```

<SectionMessage appearance="warning">

Data attached for external consumers can be accessed by _any_ external consumer that the user drops on. It is important that you don't expose private data.

</SectionMessage>

Attaching external data from a `draggable` will not trigger the [external adapter](../external) in the `window` that the `draggable` started in, but it will trigger the external adapter in other `window`s (eg in `<iframe>`s).

## Drop target for elements

A [drop target](../../drop-targets) for elements.

The default `dropEffect` for this type of drop target is `"move"`. This lines up with our [design guides](../../design-guidelines). You can override this default with `getDropEffect()`.

```ts
import {dropTargetForElements} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

const cleanup = dropTargetForElements({
  element: myElement,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('Something started dragging in me!');
});
```

## Monitor for elements

A [monitor](../../monitors) for elements.

```ts
import {monitorForElements} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  onDragStart: () => console.log('Dragging an element');
});
```

## Types

Generally you won't need to explicitly use our provided types, but we expose a number of TypeScript types if you would like to use them.

All [events](../../events) on draggables, drop targets and monitors, are given the following base payload:

```ts
type ElementEventBasePayload = {
  location: DragLocationHistory;
  source: ElementDragPayload;
};

type ElementDragPayload = {
  element: HTMLElement;
  dragHandle: Element | null;
  data: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

For all the arguments for all events, you can use our event map type:

```ts
type ElementEventPayloadMap = {
  onDragStart: ElementEventBasePayload;
  // .. the rest of the events
};
```

Draggable feedback functions (`canDrag`, `getInitialData`, `getInitialDataForExternal`) are given the following:

```ts
type ElementGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The user input as a drag is trying to start (the `initial` input)
   */
  input: Input;
  /**
   * The `draggable` element
   */
  element: HTMLElement;
  /**
   * The `dragHandle` element for the `draggable`
   */
  dragHandle: Element | null;
};
```

Drop targets are given a little bit more information in each event:

```ts
type ElementDropTargetEventBasePayload = ElementEventBasePayload & {
  /**
   * A convenance pointer to this drop targets values
   */
  self: DropTargetRecord;
};
```

For all arguments for all events on drop targets, you can use our event map type:

```ts
type ElementDropTargetEventPayloadMap = {
  onDragStart: ElementDropTargetEventBasePayload;
  // .. the rest of the events
};
```

Drop target feedback functions (`canDrop`, `getData`, `getDropEffect`, `getIsSticky`) are given the following:

```ts
type ElementDropTargetGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users _current_ input
   */
  input: Input;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: ElementDragPayload;
  /**
   * This drop target's element
   */
  element: Element;
};
```

The monitor feedback function (`canMonitor`), is given the following:

```ts
type ElementMonitorGetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The users `initial` drag location
   */
  initial: DragLocation;
  /**
   * The data associated with the entity being dragged
   */
  source: ElementDragPayload;
};
```

You can get these type from the element adapter import:

```ts
import type {
  // Payload for the draggable being dragged
  ElementDragPayload,
  // Base events
  ElementEventBasePayload,
  ElementEventPayloadMap,
  // Drop target events
  ElementDropTargetEventBasePayload,
  ElementDropTargetEventPayloadMap,
  // Feedback types
  ElementGetFeedbackArgs,
  ElementDropTargetGetFeedbackArgs,
  ElementMonitorGetFeedbackArgs,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';
```

There are also some types (eg `DropTargetLocation`) that can be used for all adapters which can be found on our [top level utilities page](../../utilities)

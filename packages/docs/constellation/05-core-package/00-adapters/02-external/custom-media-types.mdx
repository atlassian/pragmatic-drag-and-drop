import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

When attaching data to a native drag store (for usage in external `window`s and applications), you
specific a "media type" for a string value.

```ts
{
  "text/plain": "hello world"
}
```

<SectionMessage>

"Media types" where previously known as "MIME types" (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions Type)

</SectionMessage>

When passing data between different applications, it's helpful to use common media types (eg
`"text/plain"` and `"text/uri-list"`) as other applications will know what to do with these types of
entities.

Sometimes you want to pass your own bespoke type of data to other applications, or to other
instances of your application. Passing your own type of data is a helpful signal that a particular
type of application entity is being dragged.

```ts
{
  // fallback: a url to our trello card
  "text/uri-list": card.url,

  // helpful information: a trello card is being dragged
  "application/vnd.trello-card-id": card.id
}
```

In the above example, if we see a `"application/vnd.trello-card-id"` dragging, then that is a strong
hint that a trello card is being dragged. Whereas, as `"text/uri-list"` does not help us know what
kind of entity the URL belongs to.

Things to keep in mind:

- During a drag, only the media types (`types`) of data is visible to you (platform limitation).
  After a successful drop (`onDrop()`) you can read out data (by using `source.items` or
  `source.getData(mediaType)`)
- Custom media types will be visible to all external applications when a user is dragging over them,
  and the data will be visible if the user drops on that application. So it's important not to
  expose sensitive data.

## Custom media type naming

When making your own media type, there are some conventions:

<SectionMessage>

Note, these conventions don't appear to be enforced by browsers, but for clarity and wide
compatibility, it is worth picking the most accurate one.

</SectionMessage>

- **vendor tree** (prefix: `vnd.`) for publicaly available products (eg
  `"application/vnd.trello-card-id"`)
- **personal or vanity tree** (prefix: `prs.`) for non public products or experimental types (eg
  `"image/prs.btif"`)
- **unregistered tree** (prefix `x.`) for use only in private environments (eg
  `"application/x.trello-card-id"`)

→ [More details about media type naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)

## Media type suffixs

You can add a suffix to your media type to add extra information about the type of data being
dragged

- `"text/plain+json"`: dragging json data (same as `"application/json"`)
- `"application/vnd.trello-card+json"`: some json information about a trello card is being dragged

→ [More details about suffixs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)

## Attaching custom media

You can attach custom media for external consumers using a `draggable`

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';

draggable({
	element: myElement,
	getInitialDataForExternal: () => ({
		'application/vnd.trello-card-id': card.id,
	}),
});
```

## Consuming custom media

You can consume custom media attached from other `window`s or applications leveraging the external
adapter.

```ts
import { dropTargetForExternal } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/external/adapter';

dropTargetForExternal({
	element: myElement,
	// We are also only enabling dropping if a trello card is being dragged
	canDrop: ({ source }) => source.types.includes('application/vnd.trello-card-id'),
	onDrop: ({ source }) => {
		const cardId: string | null = source.getData('application/vnd.trello-card-id');

		if (cardId == null) {
			return;
		}
		// do drop operation
	},
});
```

Native applications will also have their own mechanisms for extracting data from externally sourced
drag operations.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#116572](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/116572)
  [`98c65e7ff719c`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/98c65e7ff719c) -
  üçØ Introducing "the honey pot fix" which is an improved workaround for a
  [painful browser bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41129937).

  **Background**

  The browser bug causes the browser to think the users pointer is continually depressed at the
  point that the user started a drag. This could lead to incorrect events being triggered, and
  incorrect styles being applied to elements that the user is not currently over during a drag.

  **Outcomes**

  - Elements will no longer receive `MouseEvent`s (eg `"mouseenter"` and `"mouseleave"`) during a
    drag (which is a violation of the
    [drag and drop specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model))
  - Elements will no longer apply `:hover` or `:active` styles during a drag. Previously consumers
    would need to disable these style rules during a drag to prevent these styles being applied.
  - Dramatically improved post drop performance. Our prior solution could require a noticeable delay
    due to a large style recalculation after a drop.

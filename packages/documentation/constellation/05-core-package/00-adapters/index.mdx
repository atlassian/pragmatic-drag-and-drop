An _adapter_ teaches Pragmatic drag and drop how to handle dragging a particular entity type:

- [element adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapters/element) → handling the dragging of
  draggable elements
- [text selection adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapters/text-selection) → handling
  the dragging of text selections
- [external adapter](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapters/external) → handling drag
  operations that started outside of the current `window` (eg files and text from other `window`s or
  applications)

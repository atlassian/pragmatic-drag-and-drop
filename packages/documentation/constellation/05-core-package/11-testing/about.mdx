description: How to test your drag and drop experiences

This library has robust unit and browser test converage, so there is no need for consumers to test
that the library is working as it should.

That said, you'll likely want to add some testing to your experiences to ensure they are working
correctly.

We have created some guides to help you with setting up tests for various environments:

- [Jest and JSDOM](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/testing/jest-and-jsdom)
- [Playwright](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/testing/playwright)
- [Cypress](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/core-package/testing/cypress)

  + @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-autoscroll

  # Note: `react` was added to this package name as our indicator package is designed for usage with `react`.

  - @atlaskit/drag-and-drop-live-region

  the ``@atlaskit/drag-and-drop*` packages left off. Doing this will make it easier to look back on
  changelogs and see how the packages have progressed.

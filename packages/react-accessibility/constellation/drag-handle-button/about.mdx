<SectionMessage appearance="warning">
	This component does not use the <Code>@atlaskit/button</Code> component, because{' '}
	<Code>@atlaskit/button</Code> cancels <Code>mousedown</Code> events and prevents dragging from
	occurring. Instead this component uses a native <Code>&lt;button&gt;</Code> element.
</SectionMessage>

## Default

<Example Component={DragHandleButtonExample} />

## Small variant

A small variant is available through the `/drag-handle-button-small` entrypoint.

It is intended for experiences with very limited space to accomodate a drag handle. It is not
recommended for general use due to the small target size.

<Example Component={DragHandleButtonSmallExample} />

## Dropdown menu

This component can be composed with [Dropdown menu](/components/dropdown-menu).

Because the Dropdown menu provides a `triggerRef` you will need to merge it with your own ref in
order to use the trigger as the `dragHandle` in your `draggable()` registration.

  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.

### Minor Changes

- [#116572](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/116572)
  [`98c65e7ff719c`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/98c65e7ff719c) -
  üçØ Introducing "the honey pot fix" which is an improved workaround for a
  [painful browser bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41129937).

  **Background**

  The browser bug causes the browser to think the users pointer is continually depressed at the
  point that the user started a drag. This could lead to incorrect events being triggered, and
  incorrect styles being applied to elements that the user is not currently over during a drag.

  **Outcomes**

  - Elements will no longer receive `MouseEvent`s (eg `"mouseenter"` and `"mouseleave"`) during a
    drag (which is a violation of the
    [drag and drop specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model))
  - Elements will no longer apply `:hover` or `:active` styles during a drag. Previously consumers
    would need to disable these style rules during a drag to prevent these styles being applied.
  - Dramatically improved post drop performance. Our prior solution could require a noticeable delay
    due to a large style recalculation after a drop.

  [`8f7e827e0978`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/8f7e827e0978) -
  Some Pragmatic drag and drop packages did not have `"author"` and or `"license"` attributes set in
  their `package.json` file. These missing attributes have now been added where required.

  ```diff
  + "author": "Atlassian Pty Ltd",
  + "license": "Apache-2.0",
  ```

  All Pragmatic drag and drop packages were already licensed under `Apache-2.0` (see `LICENSE`
  files), but the `"license"` attribute in some `package.json` files was missing.

  [`34ed7b2ec63`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/34ed7b2ec63) - We have
  changed the name of our drag and drop packages to align on the single name of "Pragmatic drag and
  drop"

  ```diff
  - @atlaskit/drag-and-drop
  + @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop

  - @atlaskit/drag-and-drop-autoscroll
  + @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-autoscroll

  - @atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox
  + @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-hitbox

  - @atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator
  + @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-indicator
  # Note: `react` was added to this package name as our indicator package is designed for usage with `react`.

  - @atlaskit/drag-and-drop-live-region
  + @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-live-region

  ```

  The new `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop*` packages will start their initial versions from where
  the ``@atlaskit/drag-and-drop*` packages left off. Doing this will make it easier to look back on
  changelogs and see how the packages have progressed.

  node. Comments will now be wrapped in a new `JSXExpressionContainer` node.

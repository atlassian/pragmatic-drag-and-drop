<SectionMessage title="React 19" appearance='information'>

This package does not currently support React 19.

</SectionMessage>

This package exposes the same exports and types of `react-beautiful-dnd@13` and uses
`@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` to power those exports.

At a high level, all you need to do is swap your imports of `react-beautiful-dnd` in your code to
`@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration` and your drag and drop
experience(s) will now be powered by Pragmatic drag and drop.

This package also includes a codemod to help automatically shift over `react-beautiful-dnd@12` and
`react-beautiful-dnd@13` to `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration`.

## Prerequisites

To use `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration` you should:

1. Already be using `react-beautiful-dnd`. If this is a new feature, adopt
   `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` directly.
2. Be using major version 12 or 13 of `react-beautiful-dnd`.

## Migration steps

1. Install `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-beautiful-dnd-migration`

2. Run the codemod client with the command
   `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser {tsx|babylon} --extensions ts,tsx,js [relativePath]`.

   Select the codemod based on which version of `react-beautiful-dnd` you are using:
   1. For major version 12, select `adoption-from-rbd-12`

   2. For major version 13, select `adoption-from-rbd-13`

3. Acknowledge and remove the comments left by the codemod.

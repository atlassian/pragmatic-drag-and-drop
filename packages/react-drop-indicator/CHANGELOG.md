  [`f135a8d1066c9`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/f135a8d1066c9) -
  Updates the `react` peer dependency range to include React 19. While we expect these packages to
  work with React 19, we do not test against and there is a small risk of issues. If you have any
  problems, please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop).

  [`62f176ec5174c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/62f176ec5174c) -
  `box-without-terminal` has been removed as it is now redundant. `box-without-terminal` can now be
  achieved with `box` by leveraging `type="no-terminal"`.

  ```diff
  - import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-drop-indicator/box-without-terminal';
  + import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-drop-indicator/box';

  function Item() {
  -  return <DropIndicator edge="bottom" />
  +  return <DropIndicator edge="bottom" type="no-terminal" />
  }
  ```

  [`d2d78bed3e76f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/d2d78bed3e76f) -
  This package is moving from `@emotion/react` to [Compiled](https://compiledcssinjs.com/) for
  styling.

  [Compiled](https://compiledcssinjs.com/) is a styling solution with a tiny runtime (`~260B`) that
  you can use along side your existing styling solution(s). As long as your bundler supports CSS
  imports (eg `import './styles.css'`) then you shouldn't need to do anything!
  [More information for if you run into any difficulties](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/rfc-73-migrating-our-components-to-compiled-css-in-js/85953).

  This change has been released as a `major`, as it would require changes for consumers who do not
  have a bundler with CSS imports enabled.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#124834](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/pull-requests/124834)
  [`c6ef61f6b00d1`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/c6ef61f6b00d1) -
  **More out of the `box`**

  The API of our `box` drop indicator has been expanded to include `type` (more control over the
  terminal), `appearance` (color control) and `indent` (line shifting). See documentation for full
  usage explanation and examples.

  **`box-without-terminal` is deprecated**

  `box-without-terminal` has been deprecated as it is now redundant. `box-without-terminal` can now
  be achieved with `box` by leveraging `type="no-terminal"`.

  ```diff
  - import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-drop-indicator/box-without-terminal';
  + import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop-react-drop-indicator/box';

  function Item() {
  -  return <DropIndicator edge="bottom" />
  +  return <DropIndicator edge="bottom" type="no-terminal" />
  }
  ```

  We will remove `box-without-terminal` in the next `major` release.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

  [`e77649a3345a0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/e77649a3345a0) -
  **New: Right to left (rtl) support**

  All drop indicators now correctly support
  ["right to left" (`rtl`) rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir).

  - `box` and `tree-item`: terminals (circles) on lines are now rendered on right hand side of the
    line for `rtl` rendering
  - `tree-item`: `indent` will now correctly respect `rtl` rendering.

  **Other**

  - All drop indicators that rendered lines now leverage the same underlying base component to help
    reduce bundle size for consumers leveraging multiple types of drop indicators.

  [`f1bec731e278f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/f1bec731e278f) -
  Adds a `sideEffects` field to ensure this package does not have Compiled styles tree-shaken in the
  future to avoid an accidental regression.

  [`10a0f7f6c2027`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/10a0f7f6c2027) -
  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.

  [`8f7e827e0978`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/8f7e827e0978) -
  Some Pragmatic drag and drop packages did not have `"author"` and or `"license"` attributes set in
  their `package.json` file. These missing attributes have now been added where required.

  ```diff
  + "author": "Atlassian Pty Ltd",
  + "license": "Apache-2.0",
  ```

  All Pragmatic drag and drop packages were already licensed under `Apache-2.0` (see `LICENSE`
  files), but the `"license"` attribute in some `package.json` files was missing.

  ```diff

  [`2112070b91a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/2112070b91a) - We have
  changed the API for our _experimental_ tree drop indicator. Consumers should not be using the
  _experimental_ tree drop indicator in production before speaking with the Design System team.

  This change makes the tree item drop indicator API and usage consistent with our stable box drop
  indicator

  ```diff
  + // The import path to the tree item drop indicator has changed
  - import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator/tree';
  + import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator/tree-item';

  - // Render prop API with className as public API
  - <DropIndicator edge={edge}>({className}) => <div className={className} />
  + // Conditional rendering of an element
  + <div style={{position: 'relative'}}>{edge ? <DropIndicator edge={edge} /></div>}
  ```

  The `hasTerminal` prop has also been removed from the tree drop indicator as for trees the current
  design is that all lines have a terminal on them.

  For the fastest possible applications, it is important that `<DropIndicator>` is only doing work
  when it needs to. Making `edge` **required** forces consumers to only render the `<DropIndicator>`
  when it is actually doing something. We are using the type system to ensure the fastest possible
  usage
